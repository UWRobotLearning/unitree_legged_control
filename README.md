# Notes
- Since the A1_sport version is less than 1.20, we reverted back to 3.2 sdk version for deploying high level commands.
- While we are able to send high level commands using this sdk, the sdk does not send low level motor states via LCM.
- Although the ROS wrapper is functional for this sdk, it won't be able to pulish low level state topics.

# TBD
- Bash script for the installation of prerequisites.
- Rosbag collector launch file.
- Parser for rostopics from ros bag
- And a proper readme ðŸ˜…
